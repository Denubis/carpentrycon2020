  title: "Curriculum Development in The Carpentries"
  description: "This skill-up session is aimed at anyone who wants to learn more about how to design good lessons and the lesson development process promoted by The Carpentries.<br><br>If you'd like to create your own lesson, or contribute to the ongoing development of existing curricula, but aren't sure where to start, this session is for you!<br><br>The session will be in 2 parts. First, we will review the principles of curriculum design used for Carpentries lessons. Using the Curriculum Development Handbook, we will present how to use Backward Design to identify what to include in a lesson, decide on the exercises suitable for formative assessment, and the general development life-cycle of a lesson. In the second part, we will present and answer questions about The Carpentries Incubator and The Carpentries Lab, venues to collaborate and share community-developed lessons in the style of The Carpentries.<br><br>After attending the session, participants will be able to design new lessons in style of The Carpentries, create exercises suitable to the learning objectives of their lessons, and contribute to the development of existing curricula."

  title: "Developing Open Leadership mindset for our learners through mentoring"
  description: "Leadership skills such as openness, inclusivity, project road mapping, and community building are essential for modern science and research today. Despite this, these skills are rarely taught.<br>br>We believe that scientists and researchers should learn how to effectively lead projects openly, collaboratively, and thoughtfully from day one.To facilitate this, we created Open Life Science (http://openlifesci.org/), a 16-week training and mentorship program that prepares early career researchers and academic leaders to become open science ambassadors for their own projects but for the communities around them.<br><br>In this session, we will discuss mentoring and training our members in Open Science skills, introduce to the Open Life Science (OLS) program's open source resources, and run a “taster session” where we will touch on some of the important aspects of open research, whilst giving it the feel of a collaborative, informative and classic OLS full-cohort call."

  title: "Reproducible Environments with the Nix Packaging System"
  description: "The issue of dependency management is one which is of interest to all scientists and researchers who wish to develop reproducible results with software. The Nix package management system is one which is cross-platform and will enable the instructors to pin their dependencies to mimic perfectly, the environment of the learners, as a very basic example see https://github.com/HaoZeke/nixCarp. It is a more robust, secure and lightweight alternative to using a docker container and is a very important pedagogical tool as well. The workshop would cover the generation of nix-pkg derivations, which being written as they are in a functional style of programming, needs some description. Furthermore it would cover the best practices of the nix community when it comes to using the nix-shell environments. My experience as a nixpkg manager would let me communicate this tool to my fellow instructors and those at the event. I feel like this would be very beneficial to the audience. Nix, like git is a deep and complicated tool, but which can be used to reap fantastic dividends with a low learning curve if taught correctly."

  title: "Building institutional computational genomics capacity (de novo)"
  description: "There is a growing gap between the accumulation of big data and researchers’ knowledge about how to use it effectively. Furthermore, there seems to be great interest from the Carpentries community to learn and teach genomics. South Africa boasts 26 public universities each conducting research in areas where genomics techniques are (or can be) applied to answer questions related to health, food, environmental issues, and/or agriculture. Currently, only nine of these universities offer formal undergraduate or postgraduate training programmes in bioinformatics or computational genomics. The North-West University (NWU) isn't one of these nine. For that reason, we explored various avenues for building institutional genomics capacity. I would like to present this topic in the form of a breakout session at CarpentryCon@Home and discuss the results and challenges for each approach, as was experienced by our institution’s researchers. I would also like other people in the field of genomics to tells us how they build genomics capacity at their institutions. Together we might come up with feasible solutions to 'teach people how to fish'."

  title: "Make Your Tools, Scripts and Analyses Open and more FAIR"
  description: "Open science has rapidly gained interest and importance across the academic world and society. It will require researchers to be open and transparent in sharing their methods, analyses and raw and published data, so these can be reused, verified or reproduced by a wider audience. In the humanities and social sciences, research software (including code, scripts, tools, algorithms) often is an integral part of the methodological process, so there is a need for guidelines on making these open as well. The Netherlands eScience Center and DANS launched a website (fair-software.eu) with five practical recommendations that help researchers to make their software more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The site serves as a signpost for researchers to get actionable advice on how to get this adventure started. The general idea of the session is that workshop participants bring their code, and the session organizers will help participants to improve the openness and FAIRness of their software or scripts using the new website as guidance.<br><br>Participants of this session will
  (i) learn about the fair-software.eu website, (ii) learn about five things they can do to improve FAIRness of their software, (iii) put their code in the open, (iv) select the license, (v) find relevant software registry, (vi) make their software citable and (vii) select the quality checklist that fits their purpose.
  <br>The session addresses the challenges in opening up research software and facilitation of software sustainability."

  title: "Growing Carpentries through a growing community"
  description: "Carpentries participants need the opportunity to engage beyond workshops and it can be challenging for volunteers to dedicate more of their time to support them after the fact. Creating ways to maximize engagement without overextending the Carpentries organizers and volunteers is important for the long term sustainability of a local Carpentries community. Sharing innovative ways to create that community and promote their success can help make sure that a struggling organization is not lost."

  title: "Embedding Accessible Low-Tech Strategies Into Your Data Literacy Approach"
  description: "This session is a follow up to my recent talk: Low-Income Data Diaries - How “Low-Tech” Data Experiences Can Inspire Accessible Data Skills and Tool Design (https://youtu.be/XV_jxbB1cBY) at csv,conf,v5. In that csvconf.com talk, I made the case that a significant population of data stakeholders exist in low-technical skills and low-technological infrastructure context, and find current data literacy approaches (Data Literacy 1.0) inaccessible. The main takeaway from the csv,conf talk was the need to rethink and redesign a new approach (Data Literacy 2.0) that makes data skills and resources more accessible to these stakeholders. Whereas the prior talk set the stage for the current challenge, this session will dive into strategies and resources that I have discovered and develop to get started with embedding low-tech skills and resources into our data literacy approaches."

  title: "How to prevent and kick burnout to the curb"
  description: "Since becoming part of the Carpentries' community, I can't imagine what my life was like before. I have learned so many things in the past few year, even though it was a long, hard road and many lessons were learned. Burnout was a reality for me, and I am certain that it is for many others as well. I would thus like to propose a breakout session where people can share their experiences, challenges, and solutions to preventing/treating burnout. We not only want an active community, but a healthy one."

  title: "Frictionless data management for open and reproducible science"
  description: "Generating insight and conclusions from scientific data is not always a straightforward process. Data is often hard to find, archived in difficult to use formats, poorly structured and/or incomplete. These issues create friction and make it difficult to use, publish and share data. The Frictionless Data initiative (frictionlessdata.io) at Open Knowledge Foundation (okfn.org) aims to reduce friction in working with data, with a goal to make it effortless to transport data among different tools and platforms for further analysis, and with an emphasis on reproducible research and open data. In this workshop, participants will learn about different sources of friction in working with scientific data and how to alleviate them using the open source Frictionless Data tools. Participants will learn where to find open scientific data, how to computationally prepare this data for further analysis and generate conclusions, and also best practices for sharing data and documenting metadata. This hands-on workshop is aimed for researchers interested in open science and reproducible research that are at a beginner programming level (for instance, some familiarity with Python or R and the command line), but more advanced programmers are also welcome."

  title: "Open data and Reproducibility v2.1"
  description: "Putting Madisonian data into reproducible documents and dashboards--should be fun! <br><br>The methods for disseminating research are advancing. Papers now include more and more supplementary materials. This shift has been facilitated by burgeoning technologies and available training. Another major contributor was the replication crisis in psychology. Nowadays, researchers customarily examine the extra materials with new studies. These materials are available to non-academics, too. Standard supplementals could be dubbed Open Data and Reproducibility, Version 1. Excitingly, updated features are already available, largely based on open-source software. Let’s look at some applications using R.<br><br>Pablo Bernabeu will conduct this workshop, which uses real code of varying complexity and Madisonian data! Each of the three sections below include practice, allowing participants to get acquainted with common challenges and even to create some output."

  title: "Native scripting in Windows: the Command Prompt interface"
  description: "Software Carpentry focuses on task automation and proposes Bash shell as an effective tool to this end. However, in Windows it is not a native tool and it can lead to problems with software designed primarily for Windows (many scriptable engineering packages are such). However, there exists a native tool with capabilities comparable to that of the shell. Learning how to effectively use the command prompt would provide attendees with a technical skill very interesting to the engineering community at large. This in turn would help grow the interest in The Carpentries workshops and, in a wider perspective, the diffusion of Open Science practices in the engineering community."

  description: "Africa is said to be the World Global Commerce by 2035. Investors and global actors in most cases lack evidence-based research about Africa data from Africa source. Since data is said to be the future Gold and most valuable resources, investors are more interested about what is in it for them in Africa in order to set the investment in Africa rolling. The current data gaps, challenges and access in Africa remain a major constraints for any investor. This session aim to proffer information on how to overcome these challenges through visualization of the continent most valuable resources-Data!"

  title: "Workshop on structural equation modelling for causal inference in R"
  description: "For anyone in health, education, social sciences, ecology, genomics, genetics, software programming, and indeed any field that investigates causal thinking, graphical exploration of cause and effect is important for generation of deep insights. The free and open source R package Lavaan provides an excellent interface to explore such graphic causal models. In the workshop, I will run a Carpentry style workshop so that following the workshop, the participants will (1) gain an understanding of causal modelling, and (2) use Lavaan in R to explore graphical models for studying cause and effect relationships."

  title: "Building Text-as-Data Communities"
  description: "In this session we hope to bring together text-as-data practitioners and those in academic support roles to discuss models for building communities related to computational text analysis. Many early career scholars interested in text analytics find themselves at institutions that provide little direct support for learning and practicing emerging methods related to text as data (e.g., topic modeling or sentiment analysis). Even where expertise does exist on a particular campus, it can be difficult for an individual scholar—especially those in the humanities or social sciences—to bridge disciplinary and bureaucratic boundaries to find peers and mentors in computational research areas. The Carpentries offer one helpful foundation for learning essential data science tools; this session explores opportunities for building upon that foundation to address the growing needs and interests of scholars in text analytics. <br><br>At our institution, we recently initiated the Text as Data Practice Group, a discipline-agnostic monthly gathering for scholars to experiment and learn from each other, from local experts, and from open access tutorials in a social setting. The group operates in the spirit of creating community, nurturing peer-to-peer learning, and exploring emerging text and data analysis methods on campus. We plan to provide an overview of this program, and then lead participants through discussion prompts to share their own thoughts about successes, challenges, and opportunities related to building communities for text as data. Participants will learn about different models to develop and nurture communities in computational research."
