CarpentryCon 2020 planning is underway. It will only be possible with the generous support of businesses and foundations who support our mission of teaching foundational computational and data science skills to researchers to safeguard the future of sound, open, reproducible science.

## Why sponsor CarpentryCon 2020?

CarpentryCon 2020 is the key networking and community-building event of The Carpentries. Some of the brightest and most promising researchers and data scientists from around the world will meet to network, to learn about digital research tools, and the practice of reproducible, open science, and to further develop the coding, communication and project management skills research and industry are crying out for.

Without the support of sponsors who share our vision, we will not be able to deliver the event our community needs.

- Help us keep registration costs low so people aren't priced out of attending
- Help us maximise participation by people from diverse geographies and communities, including the global South
- Help us provide travel scholarships to allow as wide an audience as possible to attend
By supporting us, you will help skill up the next generation of research leaders, people who will attend CarpentryCon 2020 to develop the skills needed to lead 21st century research, whether that be in academia or industry. This is a perfect opportunity to promote your products and services to these research leaders of the future. In return, we can promise you a number of benefits.
